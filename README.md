# More-Tools-Survivalcraft-2
Are you tired of the default tools in Survivalcraft 2? Do you feel like using the same tools over and over is getting boring?
Check out the More Tools Mod, a mod that adds new tools to reduce your reliance on the default ones. It introduces new crafting recipes, useful features, and best of all, these tools last longer. Some of the new tools are crafted with the same items but offer unique advantages. From copper and diamond hammers to copper alloy, ice, steel, and even glass tools—there’s a lot to explore!
